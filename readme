// This is a command-line Notes Application built using Node.js.

// It allows users to perform basic CRUD operations such as adding, removing, listing, and reading notes from the terminal.

// All notes are stored locally in a file named notes.json in JSON format.

// The application uses the yargs package to handle command-line arguments like --title and --body.

// The fs module is used for reading from and writing to the file system.

// Core JavaScript methods like push, filter, find, JSON.stringify, and JSON.parse are used to manage the notes data.

// To get started, run npm install to install the required dependencies.

// To add a note, use the command:
// node app.js add --title="Book" --body="Harry Potter"

// Other available commands include:

// remove to delete a note

// list to display all notes

// read to read the contents of a specific note

// The app uses ES6 features like arrow functions for cleaner code and modular structure.

// Debugging can be done using console.log() or with the command:
// node inspect app.js, then open Chrome at chrome://inspect.

// Functions like addNote and removeNote are organized in separate modules and imported into the main file for clean and maintainable code.
